    specified in the __init__ method. The user is required to customize their action 
    methods using this blueprint as a guide.

    will either return "running", "failure", or "success" depending on the state of the action.

    The Update class is a leaf node in the behavior tree which performs some calculation/algorithm

    Each update should be tick based, so during each tick the .tick() method of an update
    will either return "failure", or "success" depending whether or not the update is successful

    return "running".

    The condition functon should be user defined and return a boolean value. 

    This class is not meant to be initialized, but serves as an abstract parent class for
